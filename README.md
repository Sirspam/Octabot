# Octabot
Octabot is a discord bot made on python with the use of discord.py.
Not every song which is on the live bot is located within 'Octagon'. The three songs are just examples and can be found on youtube. I did not make any of the songs within the 'Octagon' directory
Honestly this bot is a mess. I wouldn't recommend using this code if you're teaching yourself discord.py
