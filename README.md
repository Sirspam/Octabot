# Octabot
Octabot is a discord bot, made with discord.py, with a small handful of features.

## Features
Octabot's main feature is playing pre-installed mp3 files with addictional features such as sending users a list of all installed songs, playing those songs and playing every song in a random order. 
Octabot also features a small emote game, with saving statistics, and an image classification feature.

More information can be found within the bot's help command, ```oct$help``` and ```oct$game help```.

## Requirements and installation
To run this bot Python 3.6+ along with the discord.py[voice] module needs to be installed. 
Additional requirements are FFmpeg, which must be set up in the PATH on windows 10, and [this stunning image classification module](https://github.com/Cloud11665/Octagon).

There should be an 'Octagon' directory within the Octabot directory which would contain mp3 files for the bot to use but it's been emptied of mp3 files. Check this [readme](https://github.com/Sirspam/Octabot/blob/master/Octabot/Octagon/README.txt) for more information

To run the bot a file containing a discord bot token is needed. Simply put a file called 'Token.txt', which is containing just the discord bot token, inside of the Octabot directory. Furthermore, when first ran the program will generate an 'Octalog' file, which will log information on the bot's operations. An 'Octagame' Database file will also be generated when one of the oct$game commands are first ran.
## Information
This is my first attempt at making a discord bot along with this likely being the biggest python program I've made, so expect areas in the code which could be improved.
I don't plan to use this bot for anything, it was mainly for fun, so feel free to copy any of the code or tell me about any issues with the code. *I also hope you enjoy the lovely notes I've left in the code.*

If you want context for the theme of this bot, search "Octagon YTPMV" on Youtube. Or alternatively watch [this Glorious video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddWJatRxfz8).
