# Octabot
Octabot is a discord bot made on python with the use of discord.py, which is mainly for playing pre-installed mp3 files.

The Octagon directory would be filled with mp3 files, but they've been removed from this version of the bot.

This is my first attempt at making a discord bot, let alone a coding project this big, so expect areas in the code which could be improved.
