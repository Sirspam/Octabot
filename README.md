# Octabot
Octabot is a discord bot made on python with the use of discord.py, which is mainly for playing pre-installed mp3 files.

There should be an 'Octagon' directory, within the Octabot directory, which would contain mp3 files, for the bot to use, but they've been removed from this version of the bot.

This is my first attempt at making a discord bot, let alone a coding project this big, so expect areas in the code which could be improved.
I don't plan to use this bot for anything, it was mainly for fun, so feel free to copy any of the code or point out any issues with the code.
