# Octabot
Octabot is a discord bot made with discord.py. It's main function is playing pre-installed mp3 files.
Octabot has features such as sending users a list of all installed songs, playing those songs and playing every song in a random order. 

There should be an 'Octagon' directory within the Octabot directory which would contain mp3 files for the bot to use but it's been emptied of mp3 files. Check this [readme](https://github.com/Sirspam/Octabot/blob/master/Octabot/Octagon/README.txt) for more information

To run this bot Python 3.6+ along with the discord.py[voice] module needs to be installed. 
Additional requirements are FFmpeg, which must be set up in the PATH on windows 10, and [this stunning image classification module](https://github.com/Cloud11665/Octagon).

This is my first attempt at making a discord bot along with this likely being the biggest python program I've made, so expect areas in the code which could be improved.
I don't plan to use this bot for anything, it was mainly for fun, so feel free to copy any of the code or tell me about any issues with the code.

If you want context for the theme of this bot, search "YTP Octagon" on Youtube. Or alternatively watch [this Glorious video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddWJatRxfz8).
