This is just here so the directory appears in the github respitory.

This folder should be filled with mp3 files but they've been removed since I don't think uploading 100+ mp3 files to github is a smart idea.

The code has been purposly designed around the idea of this directory containing a ton of mp3s, so just imagine that this directory is full of songs all made from the same video of some guy talking about octagons.

**The 'octa$list' command will likely break if the Octagon directory doesn't contain enough files!**
